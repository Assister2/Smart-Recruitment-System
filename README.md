# Smart Recruitment System
A simple Django-based resume ranker website where recruiter users post jobs, candidate users apply for the job, fill in the required data, upload resumes, and 
the system shortlists the candidate resumes. The system ranks the CVs based on the document similarity of the job description and the resumes using the 
KNN model and shows the shortlist.
