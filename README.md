                                                             Smart Recruitment System 

# The web application is a job recruitment system that will evaluate the candidates automatically and will give the best applicants by analyzing their merit scores. In our system, the recruiter will post their job with a record. And the job seeker will apply for the job. After appealing for the job the applicant will participate in some personality-type questions. And there are two systems for evaluating the candidates. One is a questionnaire system, and the other is cv parsing. In the questionnaire system, the recruiters will generate several questions. Some will be based on relevant fields & the others will be based on technical questions. The other will parse the cv and will provide an evaluation score by analyzing their skills. Here the system will use a machine learning model for calculating all the scores. By combining the two system scores, the system will generate the final score and will give the best applicants by sorting them.
